**Protagonist (soliloquy):**  
"Every nightfall, as I struggle to sleep, I am haunted by the call of dreams. In this darkness lie my anxieties, doubts, and those unresolved knots in my heart."

*Gradually, a beam of light illuminates a mysterious guide, dressed in flowing robes, wearing a calm smile.*

**Guide (gently):**  
"Brave soul, this is the gateway to your dreams. Here, you will become a 'Dream Weaver,' mending the twisted dreams, facing the fears and challenges within your heart."
